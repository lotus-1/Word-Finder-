# Why:question:

Since children ask about their favourite Disney characters, we built this website to reply their question and have some description about it. :wink:

# How:question:

We created two folders :open_file_folder::

1. *Public*:
it has 3 files:

-index.html

-style.css

-index.js

2. *Src:*
it has 4 files for javascript:

-handlers.js: used new methods such as: readFileSync, writeHead etc.

-router.js: how an application’s endpoints (URLs) respond to client requests.

-server.js: where we script the functions.

-test.js: where we test our functions.

# Why server and router:question:

Server:
- It increases the load on the user’s computer and can lead to problems such as slow loading, high CPU usage and even freezing – especially if it is an older computer. Server-side scripting prevents this from happening.
- Some browsers don't support javascript, so we used it as it is "hidden".
- Server-side scripting often reduces the loading time for web pages which can improve the Google ranking of your site and prevent users leaving because of issues with site speed.
- As long as scripting takes place, the script itself is not sent to the browser, this prevents it being copied, cloned or scrutinised for hacking vulnerabilities.
- Server-side scripting offers greater protection for user privacy and is the preferred option for e-commerce, membership and social media sites.

Router:
- Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URL (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

# Difficulties:question:

YES:tired_face:!! We couldn't reach to the final result, we still haven't continued index.js where we used DOM manipulation to have the autocomplete. It was hard:sob:, but it was very interesting:squirrel:.
